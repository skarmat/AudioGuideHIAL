      content="Ladakh is a region administered by India as a union territory which constitutes a part of the larger Kashmir region and has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.
    Ladakh is bordered by the Tibet Autonomous Region to the east, the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh to the south, 
    both the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan to the west, 
    and the southwest corner of Xinjiang across the Karakoram Pass in the far north. It extends from the Siachen Glacier in the Karakoram range 
    to the north to the main Great Himalayas to the south.The eastern end, consisting of the uninhabited Aksai Chin plains, is claimed by 
    the Indian Government as part of Ladakh, and has been under Chinese control since 1962.
    In the past, Ladakh gained importance from its strategic location at the crossroads of important trade routes,
    but as Chinese authorities closed the borders between Tibet Autonomous Region and Ladakh in the 1960s, international trade dwindled. 
    Since 1974, the Government of India has successfully encouraged tourism in Ladakh. As Ladakh is strategically important, the Indian military 
    maintains a strong presence in the region.
    The largest town in Ladakh is Leh, followed by Kargil, each of which headquarters a district.
    The Leh district contains the Indus, Shyok and Nubra river valleys. The Kargil district contains the Suru, Dras and Zanskar river valleys. 
    The main populated regions are the river valleys, but the mountain slopes also support the pastoral Changpa nomads. The main religious groups in 
    the region are Muslims (mainly Shia) (46%), Buddhists (mainly Tibetan Buddhists) (40%), and Hindus (12%) with the remaining 2% made of other religions.
    Ladakh is one of the most sparsely populated regions in India. Its culture and history are closely related to that of Tibet.
    Ladakh was established as a union territory of India on 31 October, 2019, following the passage of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act. 
    Prior to that, it was part of the Jammu and Kashmir state. Ladakh is both the largest and the second least populous union territory of India."

                “HIAL is a collaborative exercise between learners and
                facilitators, and aims to inspire the seekers of knowledge to
                explore both outside and within themselves. Instead of solving
                problems with the conventional 3Rs (Reading, wRiting, and
                aRithmetic), we encourage learners to problem solve using the
                3Hs: Bright Head, Kind Heart, and Skilled Hands.” Sonam Wangchuk

                ”The secrets of your splendour are not concealed in the lines of
                your fate, nor are they hidden in the wiring of your DNA. They
                exist firmly and definitely, in the infinite potential of your
